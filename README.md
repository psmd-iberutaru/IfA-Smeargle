# IfA-Smeargle

![Development Checks](https://github.com/psmd-iberutaru/IfA-Smeargle/workflows/Development%20Checks/badge.svg?branch=master)

This is Python software to assist in the reduction and analysis of characterization data of IfA's SAPHIRA and ME1070 1k-1k arrays.

## Installation

Installing this library for usage is more or less easy. By doing this install, this library will be installed as a package into your default Python installation.

*This installation assumes that <code>pip</code> is already preinstalled, it should come with most distributions. `pip --version` to ensure that you have it installed.*

First, you need to download the source code. You can download the code by one of two ways:

- Clone this repository using Git (recommended)
- [Download via zip archive](https://github.com/psmd-iberutaru/IfA_Smeargle/archive/master.zip)

When you have downloaded the files (and extracted if need be), then please navigate to the directory that contains the program files. (Specifically, move to the same directory that contains the `setup.py` and `requirements.txt` files for IfA_Smeargle.)

To complete the installation of this package, execute the following while in the directory:

`pip install .`

(If the installation of the package fails, you can try again as some files may be held up by the operating system; or, if the issue is more serious, feel free to leave an [issue](https://github.com/psmd-iberutaru/IfA_Smeargle/issues).)

All done, the package is installed and the wheel is created. You should be able to use it normally now.
